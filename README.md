# Valentine

My implementation of the trending valentine questionnaire

### Usage

- Encode your lover's name `https://valentine-fpd3.vercel.app/encode<your-lovers-name>` 
e.g. `https://valentine-fpd3.vercel.app/encodeOlufunmilayo`
- Share the encoded url with your lover e.g. `https://valentine-fpd3.vercel.app/T2x1ZnVubWlsYXlv`
- They respond to it
- They can also share their response by visiting the same browser used to answer
the questionnaire with this url `https://valentine-fpd3.vercel.app/decode`. Ask for a screenshot. it's as simple as I can
get it to be (p.s. Only them can give you their response, because it's all in their local storage).
